#' CarefullyCausal
#'
#' \pkg{CarefullyCausal} performs outcome regression, IPTW, S-standardization, T-standardization and TMLE.
#' It provides the estimand, estimates, discusses the assumptions and provides diagnostics including interpretations.
#' It can be used when having a fixed-exposure, outcome is either dichotomous or continuous and when
#' exposure is dichotomous, multi-value or continuous.
#'
#' @param formula Specify your formula as in (Y ~ X + W)
#' @param data input your data set
#' @param family Can be "gaussian" or "binomial" and relates to the outcome of interest (dependent variable)
#' @param exposure Specify your exposure variable name (e.g. "treatment")
#' @param pvalue TRUE or FALSE, by default is FALSE and does not show the p-value
#' @param interaction Specify the interaction you want to include betwen the exposure and covariate. This is an argument for S-standardization.
#' @param boot1 The number of bootstrap iterations to get the standard error for S-and-T-standardization
#' @param boot2 The number of bootstrap iterations to get the p-value for S-and-T-standardization
#' @param standardization TRUE or FALSE, to show the S-and-T-standardization. Computationally more intensive due to bootstrap.
#' @param bins numeric, relevant when exposure is continuous. The number of bins your exposure will be categorized into.
#' @param confidence Can be "norm" or "bca", which correspond to a normal confidence interval or bias-adjusted and corrected confidence interval.
#' @param result_type Can be "log" (default), "rr" (risk ratio) or "or" (odd ratio)
#' @param outcome_SL_library Specify what estimators to use within Superlearner to estimate the outcome (g-estimation step within TMLE)
#' @param ps_SL_library Specify what estimators to use within Superlearner to estimate the propensity scores within TMLE
#' @param ps_method Can be "SL" (default) or "cbps" if ps_tmle is NULL.
#' @param ps_formula Specify the formula to estimate the propensity scores within TMLE. If empty, is uses same formula that is specified under argument formula with dependent variable being exposure.
#' @param ps_tmle It is NULL by default, user can input own estimated propensity scores. It is an n x 1 vector.
#' @param ip_weights_iptw user-specified IP weights that are used in IPTW.
