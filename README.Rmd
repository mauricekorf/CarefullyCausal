# CarefullyCausal

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->


The goal of CarefullyCausal is to provide the user a practical guide when doing causal analyses. Particularly, CarefullyCausal provides the user the estimand, a table of causal estimates, a discussion on the causal assumptions, relevant diagnostics and interpretations/explanations. The key aspects of a causal analyses are printed and discussed in detail to help the user in evaluating whether the estimated effects can be interpreted as being causal. Currently, CarefullyCausal can be used in a setting with a fixed-exposure, meaning that the exposure does not vary over time.\

Some key features:\

* **Setting**: Fixed-exposure
* **Outcome of interest**: can be dichotomous or continuous
* **Exposure of interest**: can be dichotomous, multi-value (max 4 levels) or continuous
* **Effect measures**: can be in log(odds), risk ratio or odds ratio



## Installation

You can install the development version of CarefullyCausal as follows:
```{r install, eval=FALSE}
# To download R packages from Github or other sources we need the "devtools" package
install.packages("devtools")
library("devtools")

# Now we can download the CarefullyCausal package
install_github("mauricekorf/CarefullyCausal")
library(CarefullyCausal)
```


## Example

To develop some intuition with the CarefullyCausal function and to highlight some important features, an example is step-by-step illustrated using the NHEFS^[National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey Data I Epidemiologic Follow-up Study, https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/nhefs/] data set.

### Data

In this example we will use a subset of the NHEFS data set, which is provided by Hernán MA & Robins JM (2020)
in the *Causal inference: What if* book^[Hernán MA, Robins JM (2020). Causal Inference: What If. Boca Raton: Chapman & Hall/CRC,https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/miguel-hernan/causal-inference-book/]

```{r example}
library(CarefullyCausal)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
